The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.

1. Create a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) if you haven't already.
2. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
3. Import your repository on Vercel.
4. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings.

Your website will now be live.
